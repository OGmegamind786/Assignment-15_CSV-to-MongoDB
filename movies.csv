But honestly, should it be that way? And that is what we need to start talking about... now!"

Parched,2016,4.5/5,"Star: Tannishtha Chatterjee, Radhika Apte, Surveen Chawla and Adil Hussain",Parched takes you into a disturbing and thought-provoking territory. Even as it cleverly intertwines the stories of the three protagonists all of who have had a raw deal in life.
Pink,2016,4.5/5,"Star: Amitabh Bachchan, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Andrea Tariang, Angad Bedi    ","Pink is a powerful statement on the existing feudal mindset of a majority of India, where men and women are judged by a different yardstick."
Udta Punjab,2016,4.5/5,"Star: Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Diljit Dosanjh","Post interval, the film is sometimes too indulgent and sluggish."
Talvar,2015,4.5/5,"Star: Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Neeraj Kabi, Tabu, Gajraj Rao, Sumit Gulati, Prakash Belawadi , Shishir Sharma, Kiran Khoje, Somen Mishra, Pramod Pathak, Raj Sharma, Chittaranjan Tripathy, Atul Kumar, Sakshi Bhatia, Vijay Kumar Dogra, Sumit Gulati, Alisha Parveen, Kundan Roy, Charu Shankar, Jaspal Sharma, Neyha Sharma",Talvar gets your mind ticking along the murders' mysteries while it moves your heart at two lives - and one truth - lost.

Queen,2014,4.5/5,"Star: Kangna Ranaut, Lisa Haydon, Rajkummar Rao","This film belongs to its director Vikas Bahl. Earlier, he co-directed the National-Award winning 'Chillar Party' with Nitesh Tiwari. Bollywood should blow bugles in his honour."
Satyagraha,2013,4.5/5,"Star: Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn, Manoj Bajpai, Kareena Kapoor, Arjun Rampal, Amrita Rao","More philosophical than fiery, Satyagraha adorns reality with gloss and loss."
